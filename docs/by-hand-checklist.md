# The by-hand checklist

**Status:** 2026-09-12 · **nothing on it has been run.** It is the list of things no headless run
can see, which is why they are here and not in `tools/run_tests.py`.

Every automated layer in this repository drives Godot with `--headless`, and the editor is exactly
what `--headless` does not start. So the flows below have never been exercised by anything: they
need a person, a window, and about twenty minutes. Phase 4's design asked for the checklist as a
written artefact now and for automation only if one of these regresses twice — "the checklist
becomes the manual's raw material".

Each line is one thing to do and one thing to see. Tick nothing you have not watched happen.

    godot --path demo             # the sandbox project
    godot --path dodge-the-creeps # the yardstick, with a window

---

## Owed since Phase 3

- [ ] **A windowed run of the yardstick.** `godot --path dodge-the-creeps`, press Start, play a
      round, die. The 30 headless checks assert on state; this is the one that asks whether it
      *looks* right — the sprite animates and faces the way it moves, the mobs come in from the
      edges, the score ticks, the message sequence reads at a human pace.
- [ ] **An editor session exercising Play, Build and `@tool`.** Open `demo`, edit a `.verse`, see
      the diagnostic appear per keystroke; press Play and see the edit take effect (a build happens
      on Play, not on save — `VerseEditorPlugin::_build`); use Project ▸ Tools ▸ Build Verse and see
      a failed build refuse the run and leave the last good generation running.

## Phase 4

- [ ] **Connect a Verse-declared signal through the Node panel.** Select the Player node in
      `dodge-the-creeps/player.tscn`. The Node dock's Signals list must show **`Hit`** under the
      script's own section, with no arguments, beside Godot's `body_entered`.
- [ ] **Let `_make_function` write the handler.** Connect `Hit` to another node and leave "Make
      Function" checked. The editor must write a handler into that node's `.verse` with the right
      name and no parameters, and the file must still compile.
- [ ] **A signal with arguments names them.** Do the same for the HUD's `StartGame`, and for a
      signal declared `godot_signal(tuple(int, string))` — the connect dialog must show two
      arguments, `Arg0` and `Arg1`, and the generated stub must take two parameters. (Verse tuples
      cannot name their elements; a *struct* payload would give real names and is not implemented —
      `phase-4-design.md` §13.4.)
- [ ] **A `@tool` script's configuration warning shows on the node.** Give a `@tool` script a
      `_GetConfigurationWarnings<override>():[]string` that returns one string. The node must show
      the warning triangle in the Scene dock with that text in its tooltip, and it must clear when
      the condition does.
- [ ] **An `_Input` handler receives a key.** Override `_Input<override>(Event:input_event):void` on
      a node in `demo`, print the event, and press a key with the game window focused. Nothing
      headless can press a key.
- [ ] **The inspector no longer shows the yardstick's node slots.** Open `dodge-the-creeps/main.tscn`
      and select Main: the only exported property must be `MobScene`. The nine that were there
      before Phase 4 are lookups in `_Ready` now, and a stale `node_paths` entry left in a `.tscn`
      would show up here.
- [ ] **A statics module shows in the editor.** With `@statics("...")` applied, the script's
      constants must appear where Godot shows a script's constant map — and a module naming a class
      that does not exist must say so rather than being silently empty.

## What a failure here means

These are the flows a *person* meets first and the automated layers never reach. A failure is not a
regression in something tested elsewhere; it is a gap that has never been covered. Record what you
saw in the relevant design document's "where this design was wrong" section, the way every other
correction in this repository is recorded, and only then decide whether it is worth automating.
